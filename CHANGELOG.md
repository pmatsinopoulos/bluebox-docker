## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-18

### Fixed
- Object ownership: schema objects are now correctly owned by `bluebox_admin`,
  ensuring `bb_app` gets proper permissions via DEFAULT PRIVILEGES

### Changed
- `test-build.sh` automatically uses the locally built image via `BLUEBOX_IMAGE`
  env var (no more forgetting to switch docker-compose.yaml)
- `generate-dumps.sh` auto-injects `SET ROLE` statements into the schema dump
  for correct object ownership
- `start.sh` shows init script progress during startup instead of only dots
- `test-build.sh` shows init script progress during data load verification
- `docker-compose.yaml` image is now configurable via `BLUEBOX_IMAGE` env var
  (defaults to `ghcr.io/ryanbooz/bluebox-postgres`, no change for existing users)
